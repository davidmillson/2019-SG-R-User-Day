# 2019-SG-R-User-Day
Shiny app for my talk on debugging Shiny apps at the 2019 Scottish Government R User Day. 

The talk focusses on two key requirements in debugging (knowing what the code is supposed to do, and knowing what the code actually does), demonstrates that this can be particularly difficult in Shiny, and shows some methods of dealing with that difficulty.

The files in Code/ui hold notes for each slide, without which it would be a bit difficult to follow.
